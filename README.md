# VBA-challenge

In this assignment, I faced the challenging task of creating a sophisticated VBA script designed to run on multiple sheets simultaneously. Initially, I was overwhelmed by the complexity of the project. However, with the help of online resources, guidance from Mr. Excel and a bit of hair loss, I gradually overcame the obstacles.

My first struggle was ensuring that the script would run on each worksheet.

Following that, I wrestled with outputting the correct ticker symbol to the appropriate column.

Then, I had to calculate the yearly change and percentage change from the opening price at the start of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

Furthermore i attempted to calculate total stock volume for each ticker.

In the end, I tackled the bonus task using online materials, which mostly required modifying parts of existing code to fit my particular worksheet.

I have uploaded screenshots of my results for 2018, 2019, and 2020 to the repository as evidence of my hard work.

Additionally, I have uploaded both VBA and text files for easier access to my code.

The following are some of the helpful resources I used during this challenging journey:
